# SINGLE PORT RAM

  >In single port RAM ,only single address line is present ,which means at a time we can only either read or write a data
  >this is a code for depth of 64 address and each address stores 8bits=1bytes

## WAVEFORM
    
  >In the waveforn 'addr' variable represents addess line of 6 bit to represent all 64 address, 'datain' represents the data we are feeding to the RAM, 'dataout' variable represents the data we are reading from the memory
    
   >first showing the writing operation , here we have store data till address 6 starting from addess 1 , after writing we done the reading data from RAM.
